# Blender

Model item so that it is facing -Y direction (this is the normaly way in Blender)
Make sure to Ctrl-A and apply all (rotations, scales etc)
Export to FBX
    Include:
        Limit to Selected Objects
        Object Types: Mesh
    Transform:
        Apply Scalings: FBX All
        Forward: -Y Forward
        Up: Z Up
        Apply Unit: Ticked


# Unity
In FBX, go to Model. Default settings should be fine except:
    Bake Axis Conversion: Ticked

Now when you bring ther FBX into the scene the orientation should be in the normal Unity axes (+Z is forward, +Y is up)
